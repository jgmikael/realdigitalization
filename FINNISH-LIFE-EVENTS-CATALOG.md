## 📝 Notes on Finnish Ministry of Finance Initiatives

**Context (2023-2024):**
The Finnish government has been systematically mapping all significant life events and business events to identify digitalization opportunities. The goal is to move from:

- **Organization-centric** (citizen visits each agency) 
- **To life-event-centric** (system orchestrates around citizen needs)

**Key Initiatives:**
- **EOAVH Project** (Edesmenneen omaisen asioiden vaivaton hoito) - Death event automation
- **Company formation streamlining** - "One-stop-shop" for business registration
- **Data portability pilots** - Citizens carry their data (MyData principles)
- **API-first mandate** - All public services must expose APIs by 2025-2027
- **Suomi.fi integration** - Unified portal for all government services

**Alignment with Real Digitalization Vision:**
These 60+ life events and 69+ business events represent the **service matrix** that the Real Digitalization infrastructure enables. Each event becomes a trigger in the event-driven architecture, orchestrated by AI agents, leveraging:
- EUDI/Business Wallets for credentials
- Federated Data Spaces for data sharing
- Trust Registry for verification
- API Catalog for service invocation
