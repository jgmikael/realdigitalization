## 🎯 The Vision

This project presents a strategic vision for Finland's future digital infrastructure (3-10 year horizon), showcasing how next-generation capabilities can transform fragmented, organization-centric public services into seamless, life-event orchestrated ecosystems.

### From Silos to Ecosystems

**Today:** Citizens navigate services across organizational boundaries, manually orchestrating their interactions with government, repeatedly submitting the same information.

**Tomorrow:** Life events (birth, employment, property purchase) and business events (company formation, international trade, hiring) trigger coordinated, AI-orchestrated service responses across entire ecosystems—automatically.

---

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Capabilities

The vision is built on 9 foundational capabilities:

### 1. 🔗 Finnish Interoperability Platform
National semantic layer (SKOS, OWL, SHACL) enabling standardized, machine-readable data products across all participants.

**Status:** ✅ Production  
**Platform:** [yhteentoimiva.suomi.fi](https://yhteentoimiva.suomi.fi/)

### 2. 📱 EU Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI)
Personal vault for verifiable credentials—portable, verifiable, user-controlled identity and documents.

**Status:** 🔄 2026  
**Info:** [EU Digital Identity](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eudi-wallet)

### 3. 🏢 EU Business Wallet (EBW)
Organizational credential vault for companies—trade documents, compliance certificates, attestations.

**Status:** 🔄 2027  
**Demo:** [Trade Automation](https://github.com/jgmikael/trade-automation)

### 4. ⚡ Event-Driven Architecture
National event mesh where life and business events trigger coordinated, real-time service responses.

**Status:** 🔄 Emerging

### 5. 🌐 Federated Data Spaces
Domain-specific ecosystems (health, education, business) enabling secure, permissioned data flows under common governance.

**Status:** 🔄 2025+

### 6. 🤖 Agentic AI Layer
Autonomous agents that orchestrate multi-service journeys, understand intent, and handle exceptions.

**Status:** 🔄 2026-2028

### 7. 🔐 Zero-Knowledge Proofs
Privacy-preserving verification—prove attributes (age, income, qualifications) without revealing data.

**Status:** 🔄 2027+

### 8. 🔌 National API Catalog
Standardized, semantic APIs for all public services with machine-readable specifications.

**Status:** 🔄 Expanding

### 9. ✅ Distributed Trust Registry
National registry of authorized issuers, verifiers, and credential schemas.

**Status:** 🔄 2026
